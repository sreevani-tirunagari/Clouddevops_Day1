				<h2>1. Computing services</h2>
				<br>
				<center>
					<p> AWS and Google Cloud use different types of containers in cloud computing. AWS uses Kubernetes while Google Cloud uses Docker and Kubernetes. In AWS, infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is offered using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. Google Cloud platform uses Google Compute Engine to offer this service.</p>

				<h2>2. Storage</h2> <br>
				<center>
					<p> Google Cloud platform has a storage of 1 GB to 64 TB. AWS platform has a storage of 1 GB to 16 TB. The provisioned IOPS (input/output operations per second) is 4 GB to 16 TB. AWS uses Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) in file storage while Google Cloud uses Cloud Filestore.</p>

				<h2>3. Big Data analysis</h2> <br>
				<center>	
					<p> These services use different techniques to analyze Big Data. AWSLamba is used by AWS while Google Cloud employs AI-First for data management. The main service of Google Cloud is the Compute Engine. EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is the main compute service of AWS. In 2017, AWS announced a per-second billing for services such as EC2 and EBS. This type of billing was extended to other services such as AWS Batch, Amazon EMR, and provisioned IOPS. In the same year, Google announced that it had extended per-second billing to Cloud Dataproc, Container Engine, and Compute Engine. This clearly shows there is price competition between these services.

                        Google Cloud platform offers its customers discounts (Committed Use Discounts) that do not come with upfront costs. To counter this, AWS provides Reserve Instances as a way of offering discounts to its customers. Google Cloud has made an extra step in enhancing cost-saving by offering sustained user discounts.</p>
