		<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cloud computing services have grown tremendously in the recent past. Businesses are using these services to manage their storage, networks, and data processing. Many companies have shifted from the use of local servers to cloud computing services because they are secure, reliable, and cost-efficient.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			<h3>What is AWS?</h3>
	<br>
			<center>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides APIs and a cloud computing platform to individuals, companies, and governments. The AWS platform offers cloud computing solutions that are flexible, easy-to-use, scalable, reliable, and cost-effective.

					It also consists of offerings such as infrastructure as a service (IAAS), software as a service (SAAS), and platform as a service (PAAS). Examples of the services provided by AWS include networking, storage, remote computing, mobile development, email, analytics, and security.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

				<h3> Amazon API Gateway </h3>
	<br>			
				<img src="img.jpg" alt="6 types" width="400" height="300">
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>	Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. With a few clicks in the AWS Management Console, you can create an API that acts as a "front door" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your back-end services, such as workloads running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), code running on AWS Lambda, or any web application.</p>
	<br>
	<p> Amazon API Gateway handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, authorization and access control, monitoring, and API version management. Amazon API Gateway has no minimum fees or startup costs. You pay only for the API calls you receive and the amount of data transferred out.</p>
